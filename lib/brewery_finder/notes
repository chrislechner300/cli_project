My goal with this project is to have a user be able to access a list of breweries and then
 be able to select a brewery from the list and get the address and website, if one is
 availabe, for the selected brewery.

first "menu"
    |
    |
    V
list of breweries
    |
    |
    V
brewery info
    |
    |
    V
select again or exit



Thats pretty much a rough idea of how I want this project to flow.
