# BreweryFinder

I created this gem to find the address and website of local breweries. It is just a small
list of some breweries in the Denver area and in the future I plan to expand on the list
but for now it is very minimal to satisfy the requirements of my first project.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'brewery_finder'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install brewery_finder

## Usage

To run this gem: ruby bin/run  

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
